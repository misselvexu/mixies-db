 * without the need for locking. The occurrence of such an error then needs to be handled properly
 * (i.e. by retrying an operation). Therefore some methods (e.g. {@link BaseMapper#tryUpdate(BaseEntity)}
 * throw this dedicated exception to permit the application code to handle this case properly.
